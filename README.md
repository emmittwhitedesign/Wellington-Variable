Wellington Variable is an experimental type project created by Emmitt White for the 2025 RIT Graphic Design Capstone. 

It combines four styles from across type history:
  A textura blackletter inspired by the _Mainz Psalter_ in 1457.
  A modern serif similar to the likes of Bodoni.
  A circular geometric sans built from the same brick and bones that began at the Bauhaus.
  A geometric blackletter that (kinda) combines these constituent components into a crazy conclusion.

It does not have upper case letters, numerals, foreign language support, or much punctuation. One day it may, if I encounter an unprecedented influx of motivation, purpose and focus.
